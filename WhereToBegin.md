# Where to begin?
If you want to market online, there are a few simple questions you need to ask yourself before you start. If you don't take the time to answer all of these questions, you will not get the results you want from your internet promotion.

## 1. Who am I? The mission and the value of your company

The mission of your company is the reason it exists. You should know your mission before starting your campaign because your mission will determine how you communicate online. Therefore, when creating your mission, it is vital to add things that will distinguish you from your competitors and help customers understand the value you bring. Creating your mission needs to be done before you use any marketing tools online or offline.

Our academy's mission is straightforward.

We help people to become experts in digital marketing.

Accordingly, our primary audience is entrepreneurs, marketers, and internet marketing specialists who want to increase their online sales on all channels. Think about what your company's mission is. If it is not yet shaped, try to think about what you want to communicate to your audience. You must come up with a good mission because it will be present on all your marketing platforms. Do not continue with your marketing campaign until you have come up with a solid mission.

## 2. What do I offer? Product or Service

The product phase is about answering the question of "what do we offer?" How your product is perceived is very important. People have to understand your product or service and how it differs from your competitors' products and prices. I recently conducted training for a company that sells dental equipment. When we started analyzing their competitors' advertisements, we saw a few interesting things worth noting. When we did a Google search for "dental equipment sales," we found ten competitors with almost identical ads. The main message was, "our dental equipment is high quality." I can hardly imagine at least one company that would describe its equipment as that of poor quality. From what I saw, there was nothing special about their unique sales propositions. From a product perspective, your unique sales proposition is extremely important. You want to stand out and be different from everyone else! Do not use generic USP's because this will make your product seem dull.

## 3. Where am I? analysis of niches and existing competitors.

Where does your company stand at this moment in the market? You must understand where you are in the market, what tools your competitors are using, and how they communicate with their audience. There are many tools available on the internet that allow you to see how much traffic your competitors get. You can also see what channels and sources this traffic is coming from and how your company stacks up with theirs.

One of the first tools that you should use is SimilarWeb.com. SimilarWeb can analyze all sites except for those with less than 50,000 visits per month. Other tools such as SEMRush.com, Serpstat, and Ahrefs can help you explore what your competitors are doing in keyword searches. If you want to gain a detailed insight into how your competitors perform on social media, use tools such as BuzzSumo, Ahrefs, and SemanticForce. You must conduct a competitive analysis before you start a promotion, generate content, or drive traffic to your site. As you can already see, they're many things that go into making a great campaign. If you have a good mission, a unique sales proposition, and an understanding of the competitive environment, you will be able to form a high-quality strategy for your project. If this seems like a lot to take in, don't worry; we'll go through everything in detail later on.

## 4. Why go online? Establishing a key performance indicators (KPI's) system and setting up web analytics.

Analytics is the core of digital marketing. With the right approach, you can measure everything! But instead of measuring the things that affect your business (sales, requests, orders, calls), I typically see beginners measuring things that are just easy to measure. For instance, likes on social networks, tweets, and shares. You don't need to bother with these things. It would help if you focused on leads, calls, and orders that you can get from social networks.

Web analytics provide an understanding of which key performance indicators you need to pay attention to succeed. For example, a service like Google Analytics will analyze who your client is, what sources bring audiences to you, and which content works best. Once you have clearly defined the goals and indicators you will be measuring; you can now use Google Analytics to determine who your client is and what sources and traffic channels bring the most buyers to your website.

You must understand that the online decision-making process is long. For example: (see the image above) this is how our client decided to buy our course. We communicated with him through our newsletters, emails, search engines, etc... There was multichannel online communication. The goal here is to communicate with a person via multiple channels before he buys something from us. You must be prepared for multichannel communication. With the proper setup of analytics and measurement systems, you can find out and calculate all of this. Later on, in this book, we will explain what specific tools can measure inbound leads, calls, and orders and convert these requests to real sales.

## 5. Who is our client? Creation of a target audience's portrait - characters, personalities, avatars, etc...

Who are the people we want to target online? When a client comes to our agency, we ask them to describe who has a demand for their product and service. We usually get one of two answers. Some say that their audience is everybody (something like 'the product is good, and everyone needs it'). The second situation is a sort of fantasy scenario. For example: our client is "a 25-year-old man who drives a used foreign car".

To have a clear portrait of your potential client, you will need some expertise in a particular set of tools. This book will help you use specific sets of tools that are available for free or cost little money. These will help you get a clear picture of the people who want to visit your website and buy from your website. We can get specific in what we can find out about a potential client like their gender, interests, where they live, and what devices they use to access your website. You will find out how they consume your content, on what days, and at what time of the day. You will have Ð° clear understanding of what needs, fears, and biases they have towards your product. This is all done with simple, straightforward tools, and you will learn how to apply them to your marketing strategy. Only after you have drawn a detailed portrait of your buyer can you start generating and creating content for them.

## 6. What? Content types that are currently working.

We will learn how to address the needs of your buyer persona using content. We will discuss content strategies, but first, let's define what types of content there are.

Professional, where you share your expertise.

Specialized, which shows your understanding of what is happening in the market and where you are heading to.

Personal, establishes you as a company and brand with a human face.

You need to choose the correct proportions for these components and transform them into text, video, and event content. Content is the core of all of your online marketing. It removes the audience's problem and allows you to build regular communication with the client and form a community around the brand.

## 7. How to promote? Promotion and content seeding tools.

Once you've created your content, it's crucial to apply it correctly. Promotion tools will be traffic sources that respond to the generated demand. Search engine optimization, search advertising, and price comparison websites are the tools that will inform a person what your product and service is, even if they do not know about it yet.

Demand generation tools are banner advertising, video advertising, online public relations, social media advertising, and teaser ads. Tools that allow you to re-communicate with the person who visited your website are social networks, email newsletters, push-notifications, SMS, and remarketing tools (also known as retargeting). All these tools work cohesively as one unit to create great content for your product. We'll show you how to use these tools to promote your brand and increase your sales.

## 8. Could it be better? Regular improvement.

Many entrepreneurs believe that the internet is a magic button; however, it is a standard business process to continually advance, improve your content and website, improve traffic and your decision-making funnel. You need to work to make these things better. Remember that these tools will allow you to start your online promotion properly.
